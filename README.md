This repository demonstrates a common yet easily overlooked HTML/JavaScript error. The bug arises from attempting to manipulate a DOM element that doesn't exist in the document. This often occurs when dynamically adding elements or when relying on element IDs that might not be present during a certain execution path.

The solution showcases how to implement a check for the element's existence using a conditional statement, such as an 'if' statement, before making any changes. This robust approach prevents runtime errors and ensures smoother operation. The solution file shows how this check can be implemented efficiently to prevent errors.
